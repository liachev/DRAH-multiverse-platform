3. **Financing Options**: The dual approach of discounted full payment or easy financing provides flexibility for users with different financial situations

## Implementation Considerations
- Need to adapt the reservation system for housing developments rather than vacant land
- Should consider implementing a similar processing fee structure to cover administrative costs
- Can expand the reservation period beyond 48 hours for housing developments with longer decision timelines
- Should incorporate the transparent pricing and clear title guarantee concepts
- Need to develop a similar property vetting process specific to disaster recovery housing
