# Automated Deployment Configuration for Multiverse Platform

This file contains the configuration for the automated deployment pipeline for the Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange.

## Netlify Configuration

The platform uses Netlify for serverless deployment with the following features:
- Frontend hosting with CDN distribution
- Serverless backend functions
- Continuous deployment from GitHub
- Form handling
- Identity management
- Environment variable management

## MongoDB Atlas Integration

The platform connects to MongoDB Atlas for database services with:
- Auto-scaling clusters
- Automated backups
- Network security
- Database monitoring

## Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline is fully automated with zero human intervention required:

1. Code changes pushed to GitHub repository
2. Netlify build hooks triggered automatically
3. Frontend built with optimized assets
4. Backend functions packaged for serverless deployment
5. Database connection configured via environment variables
6. Deployment to production environment
7. Post-deployment tests run automatically
8. Notification of deployment status

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in Netlify:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Connection string for MongoDB Atlas
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication
- `API_URL`: Base URL for API endpoints
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)
- `SITE_URL`: Public URL of the deployed site

```

## Continuous Integration

The platform uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration with:
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Dependency updates
