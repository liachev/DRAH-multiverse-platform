# Property Listing Scraping Techniques

## Overview
Property listing scraping is a critical component for our Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange, particularly for the DRAH real estate component that needs to display vacant lots for disaster recovery and affordable housing initiatives. This document explores techniques and approaches for implementing an effective property listing scraper.

## Key Scraping Techniques

### Python-Based Scraping Solutions

#### 1. BeautifulSoup and Requests
- Popular libraries for basic web scraping
- BeautifulSoup parses HTML content
- Requests library handles HTTP requests
- Good for static websites with simple structures
- Example implementation:
  ```python
  import requests
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  
  url = "https://example-property-site.com/listings"
  response = requests.get(url)
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
  
  # Extract property listings
  listings = soup.find_all('div', class_='property-listing')
  ```

#### 2. Selenium for Dynamic Content
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content
- Automates browser interactions
- Can navigate pagination and interactive elements
- More resource-intensive but handles modern websites
- Example implementation:
  ```python
  from selenium import webdriver
  from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
  
  options = Options()
  options.headless = True
  driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
  
  driver.get("https://example-property-site.com/listings")
  # Wait for dynamic content to load
  driver.implicitly_wait(10)
  
  # Extract property data
  listings = driver.find_elements_by_class_name('property-listing')
  ```

#### 3. Scrapy Framework
- Complete framework for large-scale scraping
- Handles request scheduling, pipelines, and data processing
- Built-in support for following links and pagination
- Good for complex scraping projects
- Example implementation:
  ```python
  import scrapy
  
  class PropertySpider(scrapy.Spider):
      name = "properties"
      start_urls = ["https://example-property-site.com/listings"]
      
      def parse(self, response):
          for listing in response.css('div.property-listing'):
              yield {
                  'address': listing.css('span.address::text').get(),
                  'price': listing.css('span.price::text').get(),
                  'size': listing.css('span.size::text').get(),
              }
              
          # Follow pagination
          next_page = response.css('a.next-page::attr(href)').get()
          if next_page:
              yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
  ```

### Anti-Detection Strategies

#### 1. Request Rate Limiting
- Implement delays between requests (e.g., 1-5 seconds)
- Use random intervals to appear more human-like
- Distribute requests over time to avoid triggering rate limits

#### 2. Rotating User Agents
- Cycle through different browser user-agent strings
- Makes requests appear to come from different browsers
- Reduces likelihood of being blocked

#### 3. Proxy Rotation
- Use multiple IP addresses for requests
- Distribute requests across different proxies
- Helps avoid IP-based blocking

#### 4. Headless Browser Configuration
- Configure browser to appear as regular user
- Disable webdriver flags that identify automation
- Mimic human-like browsing patterns

## Specific Implementation for DRAH Requirements

### Target Data Sources
- Propwire sites across the US
- Local real estate listing services
- County property databases
- Foreclosure listings
- Land bank inventories

### Data Points to Extract
- Property address and location
- Lot size and dimensions
- Zoning information
- Asking price
- Property status (vacant, foreclosed, etc.)
- Tax information
- Proximity to amenities
- Flood zone or disaster risk information

### Location-Based Filtering
- Filter by specific zip codes (70032, 70043, 70075, 70092)
- Filter by city names (e.g., St. Bernard Parish)
- Implement geolocation-based searches
- Store geographic coordinates for mapping integration

### Data Storage and Processing
- Store raw scraped data in a staging database
- Clean and normalize addresses and location data
- Validate property information against multiple sources
- Implement regular update schedule to keep listings current
- Archive historical listing data for trend analysis

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Terms of Service Compliance
- Review and respect each site's terms of service
- Implement proper identification in user-agent strings
- Consider obtaining permission for commercial use of data

### Rate Limiting and Server Load
- Implement responsible scraping practices
- Avoid overloading target websites with requests
- Schedule scraping during off-peak hours

### Data Privacy
- Remove or anonymize personal information
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations
- Implement secure storage for sensitive property data

### Attribution and Data Usage
- Properly attribute data sources where required
- Understand limitations on commercial use of scraped data
- Consider complementing scraped data with official API sources

## Integration with Platform

### Automated Scraping Pipeline
- Schedule regular scraping jobs (daily/weekly)
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
- Set up monitoring for scraper performance
- Create alerts for changes in website structures

### Data Validation and Enrichment
- Cross-reference scraped data with official sources
- Enrich listings with additional data (schools, crime rates, etc.)
- Implement data quality checks and validation rules
- Flag suspicious or incomplete listings for manual review

### User Interface Integration
- Display scraped listings on DRAH landing pages
- Implement filtering and search functionality
- Create map-based visualization of vacant lots
- Enable users to save or track specific properties

## Next Steps
- Select specific target websites for initial implementation
- Develop prototype scrapers for high-priority sources
- Create data schema for storing property listings
- Implement initial scraping pipeline with monitoring
- Test data quality and coverage for target zip codes
