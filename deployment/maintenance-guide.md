# Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange - Maintenance Guide

This document provides guidelines for maintaining and extending the Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange.

## Regular Maintenance

### Database Maintenance

1. **MongoDB Atlas Backups**:
   - Verify automated backups are running daily
   - Perform manual backups before major updates
   - Test restore procedures quarterly

2. **Database Performance**:
   - Monitor query performance using MongoDB Atlas dashboard
   - Create indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Archive old data periodically to maintain performance

### Code Maintenance

1. **Dependency Updates**:
   - Run `npm audit` monthly to check for security vulnerabilities
   - Update dependencies quarterly using `npm update`
   - Test thoroughly after dependency updates

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Monitor API usage and performance
   - Check for deprecated endpoints
   - Maintain backward compatibility when updating APIs

### Infrastructure Maintenance

1. **Netlify Functions**:
   - Monitor function execution times and memory usage
   - Optimize functions that approach limits
   - Split large functions into smaller ones if necessary

2. **Frontend Performance**:
   - Run Lighthouse audits monthly
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Implement performance improvements as needed

## Extending the Platform

### Adding New Features

1. **Planning**:
   - Document feature requirements
   - Design database schema changes
   - Create wireframes for UI components

2. **Implementation**:
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Create new components in appropriate directories
   - Add new API endpoints in separate files

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for new components and functions
   - Add integration tests for new features
   - Update test.sh script to include new tests

4. **Deployment**:
   - Test new features in development environment
   - Deploy to staging environment for validation
   - Use automated deployment for production

### Adding New Models

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Create new model file in `/backend/models/`
   - Define schema with proper validation
   - Add relationships to existing models as needed

2. **API Integration**:
   - Create new API endpoints in `/backend/functions/`
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add authentication and authorization

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Create new components in `/frontend/src/components/`
   - Add new pages in `/frontend/src/pages/`
   - Update navigation and routing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Check MongoDB Atlas status
   - Verify connection string in environment variables
   - Check network connectivity

2. **API Errors**:
   - Check server logs for error messages
   - Verify request format and parameters
   - Test endpoints using Postman or similar tool

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
   - Verify Netlify configuration
   - Test build process locally

### Monitoring

1. **Error Tracking**:
   - Set up error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry)
   - Configure alerts for critical errors
   - Review error logs regularly

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track database query performance
   - Monitor frontend load times

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - Regularly audit user access
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Rotate JWT secrets periodically

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Implement proper data access controls
   - Regularly review data retention policies

3. **API Security**:
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Validate all input data

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Daily automated backups of MongoDB data
   - Weekly backups of application code
   - Monthly full system backups

2. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Document step-by-step recovery process
   - Test recovery procedures quarterly
   - Maintain backup restoration scripts

## Conclusion

Regular maintenance and careful extension of the Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange will ensure its continued performance, security, and relevance. Follow these guidelines to maintain the platform effectively and extend it with new features as needed.
