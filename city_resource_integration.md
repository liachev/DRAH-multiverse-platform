# City Resource Integration Research

## Overview
Integration with city resources is a critical component for the DRAH real estate platform, providing users with access to essential information about properties, taxes, permits, and geographic data. This document outlines the key findings from research on city resource integration options.

## Key City Resources to Integrate

### GIS Maps
- Geographic Information System (GIS) maps provide spatial data visualization for properties
- Examples include PortlandMaps and CMap (Clackamas County)
- Integration allows users to view property boundaries, zoning, and geographic features
- APIs or embedded maps can be used to display this information within our platform

### Property Assessors
- Assessor databases contain official property valuations and characteristics
- Integration provides users with accurate property value information
- Examples include county assessor databases like Multnomah County's property search tools
- Data typically includes property size, improvements, and assessed value

### Tax Information
- Tax departments maintain records of property tax amounts, payment history, and due dates
- Integration helps users understand tax obligations for properties
- Examples include Clackamas County's Assessment & Taxation system
- Data includes tax rates, payment status, and tax lot identification

### Building Permits
- Permit databases track construction approvals, inspections, and code compliance
- Integration allows users to view permit history and active permits for properties
- Examples include Portland's permit system accessible through PortlandMaps
- Data includes permit types, status, and associated documents

## Integration Approaches

### Direct API Integration
- Many municipalities offer APIs for accessing their GIS and property data
- Requires registration and possibly API keys for each jurisdiction
- Provides real-time data but requires maintenance for each API connection

### Data Scraping
- For resources without APIs, controlled scraping may be necessary
- Must respect terms of service and rate limits
- Can be scheduled to run periodically to update local database

### Embedded Maps and Links
- Simplest approach is to provide direct links to official resources
- Can embed maps using iframes where permitted
- Reduces development complexity but may provide less seamless user experience

### Aggregation Services
- Third-party services may already aggregate multiple municipal data sources
- Could provide a single integration point rather than connecting to each municipality
- May involve licensing fees but simplifies maintenance

## Implementation Considerations

### Geographic Coverage
- Must support the specific zip codes mentioned (70032, 70043, 70075, 70092)
- Should be scalable to add new jurisdictions as DRAH expands
- Priority should be given to areas with high disaster recovery needs

### Data Freshness
- Property and tax data must be kept current
- Consider implementing update schedules based on municipal data refresh cycles
- Provide clear timestamps to users indicating when data was last updated

### User Experience
- Integration should be seamless within the platform interface
- Consider implementing a unified search that queries multiple resources
- Provide filtering options for different types of city resources

### Legal and Compliance
- Must comply with terms of use for each municipal data source
- May need to display attribution or disclaimers for certain data
- Consider privacy implications when caching or storing municipal data

## Examples for Implementation

### St. Bernard Parish (Louisiana)
- Relevant to zip codes mentioned (70032, 70043, 70075, 70092)
- Resources to integrate:
  - St. Bernard Parish Assessor's Office
  - St. Bernard Parish GIS mapping system
  - St. Bernard Parish permit office
  - Louisiana Tax Commission resources

### Implementation Priority
1. Direct links to official resources (immediate implementation)
2. Embedded maps where permitted (short-term)
3. API integration for real-time data (medium-term)
4. Comprehensive data aggregation (long-term)

## Next Steps
- Identify specific APIs and endpoints for the target municipalities
- Determine data refresh requirements and schedules
- Design UI components for displaying integrated city resource data
- Develop a database schema to store cached municipal data
