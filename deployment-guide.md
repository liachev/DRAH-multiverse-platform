# Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange, a fully automated serverless application that combines metaverse and real-world functionalities with a focus on real estate and business solutions.

## Deployment Options

The platform can be deployed in two ways:

1. **Automated Deployment**: Zero human intervention required
2. **Manual Deployment**: Step-by-step deployment for customization

## Automated Deployment

For a completely automated deployment with zero human intervention:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/multiverse-platform.git
   cd multiverse-platform
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   chmod +x deploy-final.sh
   ./deploy-final.sh
   ```

That's it! The script will:
- Run all tests to ensure everything works properly
- Set up the MongoDB Atlas connection
- Install all dependencies
- Build the application
- Deploy to Netlify
- Verify the deployment

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer to customize the deployment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/multiverse-platform.git
   cd multiverse-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/multiverse?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   NODE_ENV=production
   API_URL=/.netlify/functions
   SITE_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```
   bash test.sh
   ```

5. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

6. Deploy to Netlify:
   ```
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```
