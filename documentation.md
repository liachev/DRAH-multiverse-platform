## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4 or higher)

### Local Deployment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Build the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
5. Set up environment variables in backend/.env
6. Start the server: `cd backend && npm start`

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend using Cloudflare Workers:

1. Update the wrangler.toml file with your Cloudflare account details
2. Run `npx wrangler publish` to deploy to Cloudflare
3. Set up a custom domain in your Cloudflare dashboard

Alternatively, you can use the provided deployment script:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Database Backups

We recommend setting up regular database backups using MongoDB's built-in tools:

```bash
mongodump --db multiverse-platform --out /path/to/backup/directory
```

### Updating the Platform

To update the platform:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Install any new dependencies: `cd backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install`
3. Build the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
4. Restart the server: `cd backend && npm start`

## Extending the Platform

### Adding New Features

The platform is designed to be modular and extensible. To add new features:

1. Create new routes in the backend/src/api/routes directory
2. Add new models in the backend/src/models directory
3. Update the frontend components in the frontend/src/components directory
4. Update the main server file (backend/src/index.js) to include the new routes

### Customizing the UI

The UI can be customized by modifying the frontend components:

1. Update the CSS files in the frontend/src/styles directory
2. Modify the React components in the frontend/src/components directory
3. Update the images and assets in the frontend/public directory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check that MongoDB is running: `sudo systemctl status mongod`
   - Verify the connection string in the .env file

2. **API Endpoint Errors**
   - Check the server logs for error messages
   - Verify that the endpoint is correctly defined in the routes file

3. **Frontend Build Issues**
   - Clear the node_modules directory and reinstall dependencies
   - Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
