# CivicSource Auction System Research

## Overview
This document outlines the auction process and procedures used by CivicSource.com for buying vacant lots and houses online. This research will inform the implementation of similar functionality in the DRAH real estate component of our Multiverse Platform Portal Exchange, while ensuring we avoid any patent or copyright infringement.

## Core Auction Process

### Three-Step Process
CivicSource implements a straightforward three-step process for property auctions:

1. **Select Property** - Users browse and select available properties
2. **Place Deposit** - Users place a deposit to initiate or participate in an auction
3. **Win Auction** - Highest bidder wins the property

### Property Types and Ownership
- Properties are sold with Louisiana tax deeds that grant full ownership
- Title insurance is included with property purchases
- Ownership transfers as soon as the deed is recorded
- Properties are available for as low as $0 plus costs

## Detailed Auction Procedures

### Initiating an Auction
- User places a deposit on the property they're interested in
- Based on search results, the deposit amount is typically $850
- This deposit starts the auction process for that specific property
- The deposit serves as a commitment from the potential buyer

### Bidding Process
- Highest bid wins the auction
- The platform likely implements a competitive bidding system
- From other pages, we found mention of "sliding competitive bid close times"
- The system may include proxy bidding functionality

### Payment Process
- Payments must be made within 24 hours of winning
- Payment options include:
  - Online payment through the platform
  - Wire transfer (support available at 888-387-8033)
- All sales are final with no refunds
- Auction prices can range from as low as $10 plus closing costs

### Property Bundling
- CivicSource offers a property bundling feature
- Users can group three or more properties to save on costs
- This feature could be particularly useful for developers or investors

## Technical Features

### Research Tools
- The platform offers auction legal research tools
- Integrated Google and GIS parcel maps
- Property information and history

### User Experience
- Online auctions allow participation from anywhere
- Users who would normally be unable to attend in-person auctions can participate
- The platform likely includes account management features
- Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go bidding

## Implementation Considerations for DRAH

### Core Functionality to Implement
1. **Property Listing Interface**
   - Searchable database of vacant lots
   - Filtering by location (zip codes like 70032, 70043, 70075, 70092)
   - Property details and images

2. **Deposit System**
   - Secure payment processing for deposits
   - Clear indication of deposit requirements
   - Deposit management and tracking

3. **Auction Mechanism**
   - Competitive bidding system
   - Proxy bidding capabilities
   - Sliding close times to prevent last-second sniping

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Multiple payment options
   - 24-hour payment window enforcement
   - Transaction recording and receipts

5. **Property Bundling**
   - Interface for selecting multiple properties
   - Bundle discount calculations
   - Group bidding functionality

### Integration Points
1. **City Resource Links**
   - Connect to city assessors, tax departments, permits, and GIS maps
   - Property history and documentation

2. **Property Scraping**
   - Automated collection of vacant lot listings from propwire sites
   - Data normalization and verification

3. **Legal Documentation**
   - Generation of appropriate legal documents
   - Title transfer processing

### Differentiation Points
To avoid patent or copyright infringement, we should:

1. **Implement different visual design** while maintaining functionality
2. **Use different terminology** for similar processes
3. **Add unique features** not present in CivicSource
4. **Structure the database differently** while achieving similar results
5. **Implement our own algorithms** for auction mechanics
6. **Focus on disaster recovery and affordable housing** specific features

## Next Steps
1. Design database schema for auction functionality
2. Create mockups for the auction interface
3. Develop the deposit and bidding systems
4. Implement property bundling functionality
5. Integrate with payment processing
6. Connect with city resources
7. Test the complete auction flow
8. Deploy the auction system as part of the DRAH platform
